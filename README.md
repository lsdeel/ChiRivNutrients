# ChinaNutrients Project

This is the **ChinaNutrients** Project I'm about to start soon ...

Get ready for this exciting project.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project include:

1. Pick out all major stations from the national river monitoring network
2. Couple the  nutrient observations with discharge observations for Chinese Rivers
3. Estimate the total nutrients input from Chinese rivers to the Chinese Seas

This is where the national river monitoring data can be found - [river monitoring data](https://szzdjc.cnemc.cn:8070/GJZ/Business/Publish/Main.html)
